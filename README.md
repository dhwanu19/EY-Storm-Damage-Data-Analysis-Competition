# Phase 1: Tropical Cyclone Damage Assessment

## EY Open Science Data Challenge 2024 - Team Contribution Overview

### Project Description

As part of the EY Cyclone Damage Detection Competition, our team has embarked on a mission to enhance disaster response through satellite imagery analysis. Our objective is to harness the power of machine learning to differentiate between damaged and undamaged infrastructure in cyclone-affected areas.

### Team Accomplishments

- Directed a team of four in harnessing pre-cyclone and post-cyclone satellite imagery to develop a YOLOv8 deep learning model adept at evaluating areas influenced by natural calamities.
- Managed the retrieval and annotation process of high-resolution GeoEye-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, leveraging tools like the Microsoft Planetary computer database and LabelMe software.
- Achieved a commendable precision of 0.41 in model performance, ranking us in the top 5% of all entrants in the competition (55th out of 1800 participants).

### Skills Demonstrated

In the journey of completing this challenge, the team has showcased proficiency in several technical areas:

- **Python Programming**: Crafting efficient, scalable code for data analysis and model training.
- **Computer Vision**: Applying state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms for image recognition tasks.
- **Data Retrieval**: Efficiently sourcing and preprocessing large datasets for machine learning applications.
- **Feature Engineering**: Identifying and encoding relevant features from raw data to improve model performance.
- **Project Management**: Overseeing the project timeline, task allocation, and team coordination.
- **Leadership**: Leading the project vision, motivating team members, and steering the project to successful completion.

### Model Training and Evaluation

The team utilized YOLOv8 for object detection, focusing on identifying various categories of building damage. The model was trained on a curated dataset, demonstrating a strong ability to distinguish undamaged residential buildings and reasonable accuracy across other categories. Through iterative training and evaluation, we fine-tuned the model to improve its detection capabilities.
